                <h2>Greek Theatre</h2>
                <h3>The biggest, most important Greek theatre in Italy</h3>

                <p>The Greek Theatre is the greatest example of greek theater of the West. It has the distinction of being almost entirely excavated in the rock. In addition to performances, it was the custom for the ancient Greeks, the theater was used for popular assemblies. After being adapted to games in the imperial era circus, the theater fell into disuse. In the sixteenth century, as well as other classical monuments, was plundered by the Spanish masters of Charles V, who used the good stone has already been cut to build the fortifications of Ortygia. Other failures were the mills that had been implanted in the auditorium. The excavations, begun in the late eighteenth century and which continued throughout the following century were completed only in mid Novecento.
                    Pur in diversity, although substantial, opinions of scholars on the origins of the monument, it is generally accepted that the current form dates back to ' renovation of the years 238 to 215 BC during the reign of Hiero II. The theater consists of three parts: koilon (or auditorium), orchestra and stage. Koilon: has a semicircular shape with a diameter of more than 138 meters, the 67 rows are divided into nine sectors (wedges) of eight steps of service. A long corridor runs through the auditorium in breadth: it is the diazoma in the upper face of which were engraved the names of gods or rulers who had dedicated the wedge. Even today we read the names of Queen Philistis, Nereid (respectively the wife and daughter of Hiero II). The upper part of the auditorium
                    has no blocks originally placed there because of the absence of bedrock and subsequently removed in the sixteenth century under the reign of Charles V. Orchestra is the semicircular space at the foot of the auditorium where the chorus danced. The floor of the orchestra is delimited by furrows that surround a trapezoidal space, together they have been interpreted both as channels for water drainage (Euripides) as much as the traces of the old theater that originally had that. Scene: the vast esplanade where there was the stage building, bounded on either side by two massive pillars. It occurs most often excavated and because there were housing the vertical elements of the stage is greek, because over the centuries has often been tampered with to be adapted to
                    different needs construction stage, not least the gladiatorial games. The upper part of the theater was surrounded by a large covered porch. The overlying rock, as well as other parts of the Hill, is fully lined with square grooves (naiskoi) intended to accommodate the squares (pinakes) with votive images of gods or the dead eroizzati (somewhat comparable to our Saints). In it, the center and aligned with the theater opens wide cave from which the water flows coming from the aqueduct greek. In this cave - you can recognize the Mouseion nymph, which is the headquarters of the guild of artists. On the western side of the terrace leads to the upper road access to the theater (in which I am profoundly marked the driveways) along its walls have been excavated tombs
                    and Byzantine burial from which derives the name of "Street of Tombs."</p>
