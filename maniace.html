                <p>The Castle of Federico II in Siracusa, then called Maniace, was built between the 1232 and the 1240. The first documents on its foundation are the letters that Federico sent on the 17 November of the 1239 from Lodi to his subordinates relating to the construction of the castle,
                    in which the emperor welcomes the diligence with which Riccardo from Lentini prepositus aedificiorum follows the castrum nostrum Siracusa and assures him that his request pro munitione castroum nostrorum Siracusa Lentini et quam pro etiam Serracenis et servis nostris necessarium frumentum, ordeum,
                    vinum, caseum, companagium, Scarpas et indumenta that was turned over to the treasurer of Messina, who will at the earliest supply you with everything you need. Note that the Emperor uses the terms Serracenis and servis nostris,
                    referring to the workers on the job site: the Saracens, "technicians" were salaried, while the servants were not.
                    . The castle was handed over to the Kingdom of Savoy and used until the Second World War as a repository of military equipment. Following the demilitarization of the area there have been numerous restoration works (the last completed in 2010) who reported the castle to its former glory, now becoming
                    one of the castles in Sicily, and not only that, most beautiful island, a real and its symbol of power and genius of the Emperor Federico II.</p>
