                <p>In the upper side of Ortigia island, the site where stands the Cathedral of Syracuse was intended, since ancient times, to be a place to worship. A temple built in the sixth century BC, it was replaced by the Temple of Athena (or Minerva), built in honor of the goddess of the tyrant Gelone, after the great victory of Himera (480 BC) against the Carthaginians. In the seventh century, at the time of Bishop Zosimo, the temple of Athena was incorporated into a Christian church dedicated to the Nativity of Mary: in particular, walls were erected  to close the space between the columns of the peristyle and eight arches were opened, in the central cell, to allow the passage of the two aisles so obtained. The massive Doric columns are still visible on the left side, both inside and outside the building. Perhaps converted into a mosque during the Arab domination, the church was rebuilt in Norman times. The earthquake of the 1963 caused several damages, including the collapse of the facade.
                    The present facade - a masterpiece of the architect Andrea Palermo Palma, is one of the best baroque examples of  Siracusa - it was built between the 1728 and the 1754. It stands on an imposing staircase and has the column as a compositional form. The table has two floors, crowned by a pediment. Ignazio Marabitti are the two statues flanking the stairway (St. Peter and St. Paul) and those that adorn the second order (San Marciano, Saint Lucia, and the newsstand center, known as the Virgin of Piliere). The entrance is preceded by an atrium with a beautiful portal flanked by two columns in hanks, whose coils are wound along the branches of grapes.
                    The interior has three naves and a basilica. The nave is covered by a sixteenth-century wooden ceiling beams discoveries. The floor, marble and polychrome, was built by Bishop Bellomo and built in 1444. The right side of the aisle is bounded by columns of the temple, which is now giving access to chapels. In the first chapel is preserved a beautiful baptismal font, made a crater greek marble supported by seven lions in the thirteenth century wrought iron. The chapel of Saint Lucia has a beautiful silver frontal of the eighteenth century. In the niche houses the beautiful silver statue of the saint, by Pietro Rizzo (1599). The large chapel of the Crucifix, at the end of the right aisle, includes a table with St. Zosimus, perhaps by Antonello da Messina, the altar of the chapel is a wooden cross in the Byzantine style.
                    Among the other works of art held in the Cathedral, there are the many statues of Gagini, including that of the Virgin (Dominic) and Saint Lucia (Antonello) along the left aisle, and Our Lady of the Snow (Antonello) in the left apse. There are also paintings on wood and canvas of the Byzantine era, an art of the fifteenth century walnut choir, organ and choir in gilded wood with ornaments in the Corinthian style, also dating back to the fifteenth century.
