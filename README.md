# Siracysa-Website
My first Website

This is part of my assignment in Web Authoring. The version submittes for grading is slightly different in the page "Places". I had to show how to use a flex box (which is shown on the main page also).

All the pictures and the description are NOT mine and belong to their owners.
The reviews were taken from TripAdvisor.
Descriptions come from either www.siracuraturismo.net and Wikipedia.

Apologies for the spelling mistakes and/or grammar. At the present I hadn't the time to review them as I'm focusing on HTML and CSS code. I'll fix them in the final version
